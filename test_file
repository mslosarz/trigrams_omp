What is Rhetoric?

What is rhetoric? Commonly defined as the art of using language to influence or persuade people, like ‘argument’ and ‘criticism’ the term has been sullied: in everyday speech it is sometimes used to mean a hollow kind of talk employed to persuade people to believe or buy something, or to behave in a way that goes against their better judgement or wishes (by politicians, advertisers or salespeople, for instance). It is perceived as a stylistic manipulation that consciously stands at some distance from the ‘truth’. But as we have begun – and will go on – to examine, recent critics consider that every text can be scrutinised for its ideological content and its persuasive appeal, and not just those texts, like adverts, whose explicit purpose is persuasion. It was an automatic assumption for the original Greek rhetoricians of the fifth century BC that all forms of expression sought to persuade; they were interested in the method of that persuasion.

The Greeks studied the language of poetry, drama and public speeches for pedagogical reasons, in order to emulate them. Imitating successful speeches was the dominant form of education; it was the way to personal gain and career advancement. For many centuries then, the rhetoric of texts was studied for the purposes of providing a model of how to structure one’s own speeches; this is indicated by the fact that in the US the study of rhetoric is known as Composition. But during the last century, the rhetorical appeal of all texts has become the purpose of study in itself: it is the substance and not the means of study.
